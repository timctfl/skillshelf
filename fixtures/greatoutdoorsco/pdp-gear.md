# Cedar Ridge 45L Trek Pack

**Price:** $199

The Cedar Ridge 45L Trek Pack is built for long weekends and lightweight multi-day trips—big enough for food, layers, and a shelter, but not so big that it tempts you to overpack. An internal frame and supportive hipbelt keep the load stable when the trail gets steep or loose, and the pocket layout stays simple so you can find what you need without digging.

Designed in the Pacific Northwest for variable weather, the fabric is tough enough for brushy sections and treated with a PFAS-free DWR finish to shrug off drizzle, damp brush, and campsite grit.

### Fit Guidance

For the best carry, start by loosening everything, then:

1. Set the pack so the hipbelt centers over your hip bones.
2. Tighten hipbelt first (it should carry most of the load).
3. Snug shoulder straps until they contour the shoulders without lifting the hipbelt.
4. Adjust load lifters to bring weight closer to your back.
5. Fine-tune the sternum strap for breathing room.

If you’re between torso sizes, choose the larger setting for heavier loads and the smaller setting for a closer, more stable carry.
