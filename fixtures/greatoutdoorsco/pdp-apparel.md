# Cascade Rain Shell - Women's

**Price:** $149

When the forecast is “maybe,” the Cascade Rain Shell is the jacket you grab anyway. It’s light enough to live in your daypack, quiet enough for everyday wear, and built to handle real Pacific Northwest rain—not just a quick drizzle on the way to coffee.

The fit is streamlined for layering without feeling restrictive, with articulation in the shoulders and elbows for poles, scrambling, and reaching overhead. Fully taped seams and a waterproof/breathable laminate keep weather out while letting heat escape on the climb.

- PFAS-free DWR finish helps shed wet snow and sustained rain
- Adjustable, helmet-compatible hood with a structured brim
