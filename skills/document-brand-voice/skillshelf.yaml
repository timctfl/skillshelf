faq:
  - question: What does the Document Brand Voice skill do?
    answer: It analyzes 3–10 samples of your existing brand content and extracts a structured voice guide covering tone spectrums, vocabulary preferences, sentence style, formatting conventions, and rhetorical patterns. The output is a reusable reference document that any team member or AI tool can follow.
  - question: What kind of content samples should I provide?
    answer: Product descriptions, marketing emails, social media captions, About Us pages, or any writing that represents how your brand sounds. A mix of content types gives the best results. You can also flag specific samples you like or dislike so the skill weighs them accordingly.
  - question: Do I need technical skills to use this?
    answer: No. This is a beginner-level skill that works through a guided conversation. You paste your content samples and the AI walks you through a short calibration step before generating the voice guide.
  - question: How is this different from just asking AI to describe my brand voice?
    answer: A one-off prompt gives you a vague paragraph. This skill runs a structured multi-turn analysis that produces a document with named sections other skills and tools can reference. The output is designed to be a durable artifact, not a throwaway answer.
  - question: What can I do with the voice guide once it's generated?
    answer: Feed it into other SkillShelf skills as a reference input, share it with copywriters or agencies as a style guide, or attach it to any AI prompt where you need on-brand output. The guide uses a fixed heading structure so it's easy to parse programmatically.
