faq:
  - question: What does the Brand Voice Extractor do?
    answer: >-
      It analyzes your brand's existing written content and produces a
      structured voice profile covering how you write headlines, frame
      products, address customers, and make style decisions. The output
      is a reusable document that other skills consume as input.
  - question: What kind of content should I provide?
    answer: >-
      Product descriptions, marketing emails, social captions, landing
      pages, About Us copy — anything that represents how your brand
      sounds. A mix of content types gives the best results. The skill
      can also fetch content from your website.
  - question: How is this different from the Document Brand Voice skill?
    answer: >-
      The Brand Voice Extractor produces a versioned output with a
      companion glossary that tells downstream skills exactly how to
      interpret each field. This enables consistent, on-brand output
      across any skill that consumes the voice profile.
  - question: What can I do with the voice profile?
    answer: >-
      Upload it to any conversation where you need on-brand copy. Other
      SkillShelf skills (PDP writers, email generators, landing page
      builders) read the profile and its glossary to produce consistent
      output. You can also share it with copywriters as a style guide.
