# Brand Voice: Nike

<!-- brand-voice-extractor v0.1 -->

This is your brand voice profile, built from the content you provided. It captures the patterns and style decisions that make your brand's writing feel like yours. Review it, correct anything that doesn't match, and save it. When you use other skills to write copy, this document is what keeps the output on-brand.

## Voice Summary

Your brand voice is direct, confident, and action-oriented. You write in short declarative statements that assume the reader is already an athlete. You lead with emotion and experience, then back it up with product specifics.

---

The following sections describe the patterns that make your brand's writing distinctive. These are harder to reduce to a yes/no, but they're what separate generic copy from copy that sounds like yours.

## Headlines

Nike headlines are short, declarative, and action-oriented. They rarely describe the product. Instead they name a feeling, a challenge, or an identity.

Examples from source material: "Find your fast." "You don't win silver. You lose gold." "Write the future."

When a headline does reference the product, it's through what it enables, not what it is. "Air" becomes about weightlessness, not a cushioning system. The product is the means, never the subject.

Fragments are the default. Complete sentences appear occasionally but tend to be short imperatives.

## Product Framing

Nike talks about what the product lets you do or become, then mentions what it's made of. The pattern is consistent: emotional setup, then technical validation.

Example: A landing page for a running shoe opens with the feeling of a fast long run, then introduces the foam compound as the reason that feeling is possible. The spec exists to explain the experience, not the other way around.

Features are never listed without context. "ZoomX foam" always appears near "energy return" or "your fastest miles." The technical name earns credibility; the benefit earns desire.

## How Nike Talks to the Customer

Nike defaults to imperative statements directed at the reader without always using "you." "Push your limits" rather than "you can push your limits." The voice assumes the reader is already an athlete or already in motion. It doesn't invite or suggest. It affirms and challenges.

When "you" does appear, it's in moments of direct confrontation or acknowledgment: "You don't stop when you're tired. You stop when you're done." This is reserved, not constant.

Nike never talks down, never explains why exercise is good, and never positions the reader as a beginner unless the specific campaign targets new runners (and even then, the tone is "you already have what it takes").

## Persuasion Arc

Nike landing pages typically follow this structure:

1. Hero statement (short, emotional, no product name)
2. Athlete or lifestyle context (story, image-driven, 1-2 sentences of copy)
3. Product introduction through the lens of the story
4. 2-3 feature blocks, each connecting a spec to the experience
5. CTA: clean and direct

The CTA language leans transactional but confident: "Shop," "Get yours," "Find your size." Nike doesn't soften CTAs with "explore" or "discover" on product pages. Those words appear on editorial and category-level pages.

## What Nike Avoids

Nike does not: justify its pricing, acknowledge competitors by name, use "affordable" or value-oriented language, hedge with "might" or "could," over-explain benefits the reader would already understand, or use lifestyle language that feels passive ("relax," "unwind," "treat yourself"). Even loungewear copy maintains an active tone.

## Style Decisions

These are quick-reference rules pulled from your content. Scan them and update anything that doesn't match how you actually want to write.

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| Contractions | Yes, always |
| Exclamation marks | Sparingly, never in headlines |
| Emojis | Never in primary copy, occasionally in social |
| Oxford comma | Yes |
| Headline case | Sentence case or all caps, never title case |
| Price references | Avoided in brand copy, only on PDP |
| Competitor mentions | Never |
| Superlatives ("best," "most") | Rarely, prefers declarative statements |
| Urgency language | Only for genuine drops and limited releases |
| Technical specs | Present but always secondary to feeling |
| Customer address | Second person, but sparingly. Prefers imperative mood ("Run." not "You should run.") |
| Sentence length | Short. Often fragments. |
| Paragraph length | 1-2 sentences |
| Humor | Never |
| Punctuation as style | Periods on fragments for emphasis. "Just do it." not "Just do it!" |
| Primary CTAs | "Shop," "Find your size," "Get yours" |

## Example Copy

These were generated from the voice profile above. If they sound like your brand, the profile is working. If something feels off, go back and adjust.

**Product headline**
Break away. Stay grounded.

**Short product description**
Pegasus 42 strips away everything between you and the road. ZoomX foam returns energy stride after stride, and the engineered mesh upper moves when you do. 10.2 oz. 10mm drop. Built for the run that doesn't end when the route does.

**Email subject line + preview text**
Subject: Your long run just got longer.
Preview: The new Pegasus 42 is here.

**Landing page hero block**
*The road doesn't wait. Neither should you.*

Pegasus 42 was built for the run that's yours and nobody else's. Lighter, faster, and more responsive than its predecessor, with ZoomX foam that gives back more than you put in. This is what forward feels like.

**Social caption**
10.2 oz of "try and keep up." Pegasus 42. Out now.
