    This skill accepts brand context in various forms: About Us pages, pitch
    decks, homepage copy, or conversational answers to guided prompts. No fixed
    input schema. The user provides whatever positioning-relevant material they
    have, and the skill runs gap analysis to identify what's missing.

faq:
  - question: What does the Write Positioning Overview skill do?
    answer: It takes whatever brand context you have—About Us pages, pitch decks, homepage copy, or just conversational answers—and produces a structured positioning brief covering your positioning statement, target audience, value propositions, competitive context, and differentiators.
  - question: What if I don't have much brand material to start with?
    answer: The skill runs a gap analysis on whatever you provide and asks guided follow-up questions to fill in the missing pieces. You can start with as little as a homepage URL or a few sentences about what you sell and who you sell it to.
  - question: Do I need technical skills to use this?
    answer: No. This is a beginner-level skill that works through a guided conversation. You provide your existing brand materials and the AI guides you through the rest.
  - question: How is this different from just asking AI to write a positioning statement?
    answer: A one-off prompt gives you a generic paragraph. This skill produces a structured brief with named sections—positioning statement, problem, audience, differentiators, competitive context—that other skills and tools can reference by heading. It's a durable artifact, not a throwaway answer.
  - question: How does this relate to the Document Brand Voice skill?
    answer: They're complementary primitives. The positioning brief defines what you say (message, audience, differentiation). The brand voice guide defines how you say it (tone, vocabulary, style). Together they give downstream content skills a complete foundation to work from.
